PCB design is compact and meant to be connected to the Raspberry Pi CM4 board, featuring
all the ports necessary for our project. Including RPi CM4 Hirose connectors, high speed USB,
SD card slot, GPIO connectors, mini-HDMI connector, USB-C power connector and the RPi Cam
interface

Work is still in progress! PCB still needs some tweaking to be fully functional.
